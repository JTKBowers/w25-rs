This is a platform agnostic Rust driver for the W25 serial flash memory devices from Winbond using the [`embedded-hal`] traits.

## The devices

Winbond's W25X and W25Q SpiFlashÂ® Multi-I/O Memories feature the popular Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), densities from 512K-bit to 512M-bit, small erasable sectors and the industry's highest performance.

Datasheets:

## Usage

To use this driver, import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation,
then instantiate the appropriate device.

Please find additional examples using hardware in this repository: [driver-examples].
